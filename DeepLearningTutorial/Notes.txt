Intro to DL for Computer Vision
-Course uses Tensorflow and Keras (Python, obv)
-Course will start at high level instead of theory
-tensors, blah blah blah
-a convolution is a small tensor that can be multiplied over a section of the image tensor - also called filters
-each individual convolution can be used to identify/detect specific features in an image

Building Models From Convolutions
-model training determines the convolutions
-this is performed with gradient descent, backpropagation, etc.
-when running an image through a convolution, it creates a 2D tensor
-the 2D tensors from all convolutions are stacked into a 3D tensor
-moving through the different 2D tensors in the 3D tensor (the 2D tensors from the convolutions) is called the "channel" dimension
-we apply another layer of convolutions to the 3D tensor (a second layer in the CNN), etc., etc.
-once we finish with layers, we are left over with a 3D tensor that describes the image contents

Transfer Learning
-we can take a pre-trained image recognition network model and modify it slightly to identify new categories
-the higher the level of the network layer, the more complex the shape (convolution) it identifies
-knowing this, we can take a pre-trained CNN and remove the top (prediction) layer
-we can replace this with our new categories in order to take advantage of the existing convolution training
