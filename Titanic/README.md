# KaggleTitanic

This project is my code used in Kaggle's Titanic survival prediction competition.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/


### Prerequisites

You need the following python packages:
```
numpy
pandas
sklearn
seaborn
matplotlib
```

### Installing

Download and run with Python 3.6. I used 3.6.8.
The script will read the files "train.csv" and "test.csv" out of the same directory (included).
It will then analyze the data, make predictions, and save that data to "prediction.csv" (example included).

## Running

Just run the script.
